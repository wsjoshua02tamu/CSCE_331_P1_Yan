CSCE 331 Project 1: Personal Webpage

My personal professional webpage for my CSCE 331 Foundations of Software Engineering Class, written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Website includes 6 pages: A home landing page, an About Me page with a basic introduction to myself, a Resume page with my resume and some of my past experiences and qualifications, a Service page with a few selected community service opportunities, a Project page with a small portfolio of a few projects, and a ChatGPT page, which was generated using ChatGPT.

Functionality includes toggling between 2 different CSS style sheets and saving the current style to local storage via JavaScript.
